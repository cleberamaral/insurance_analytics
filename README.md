**Project Overview**

This project implements a full end-to-end data platform for a car insurance company using Databricks, MongoDB Cloud, Azure Event Hubs, and Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS Gen2). The solution centralizes data from multiple sources to create a single source of truth, enables automated claims processing, and supports machine learning models to classify car damages.

The main goals of this project are:

Consolidate customer, policy, claims, telematics, and image data into a unified Databricks Lakehouse.

Automate the claims validation process using machine learning models.

Provide low-latency analytics, dashboards, and a customer portal.
